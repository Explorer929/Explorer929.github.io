                <p>Falcon-9 is the world's most reliable reusable rocket. Falcon-9 is the primary rocket that NASA chooses to launch its missions and the primary rocket that SpaceX uses. Falcon-9 has had 427 successful launches with 2 failures resulting in a 99.5% success launch rate.</p>

                <p>It is a two staged rocket providing 1.7 million pounds of thrust. The booster of the rocket is designed to return to Earth and land on a landing pad in the ocean for future reusability. Falcon-9 has dramatically decreased the cost of spaceflight. The current cost to launch falcon-9 is about $65.7 million. Out of 892 landing attempts, about 382 have been successful. Eventually, Starship will be the successor of Falcon-9 being able to deplay more Starlink satellites and heavier payloads.</p>
