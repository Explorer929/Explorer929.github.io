                <p>Starship is the <span class="important">largest</span> and most <span class="important">powerful</span> rocket ever built, also one of the cheapest only costing around $60 million per launch. That's cheap compared to Artemis which is $4 billion per launch.</p>
                <p>Starship provides over <span class="important">16 million</span> pounds of force (lbf) and 398ft tall, even then, the rocket is planned to get 20% taller than this.</p>
                <p>Below is a table comparing Starship to other rockets. Artemis is NASA's superheavy rocket, the successor of Apollo in returning humans to the moon. SaturnV is NASA's superheavy rocket that landed humans on the moon 1969-1972. These are the three largest rockets ever launched.</p>

Elon Musk rated to booster catch to have a 50% chance of success. This is an important aspect for its launch turnarounds and reusable capabilities.</p>

                    <p class="caption">(CC bgnessnews.com) Starship fly's through the air</p>
                    
                    <p>Starship lifted off for the fifth time October 13, 2024. SpaceX was going to attempt for a tower catch on the launch pad for the first time ever. Elon Musk gave this attempt a 50% chance of success.</p>
                     <p>The launch pad tower is equipped with two arms that are supposed to come out when the booster returns to the launch pad to land. This is important for the reusability and turnaround for Starship launches.
