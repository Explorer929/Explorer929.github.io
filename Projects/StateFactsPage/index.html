        <p><b>Cons to living in Idaho</b></p>
        
        <ol style=color:white;>
            <li>High cost of living
                <ul>
                    <li>The cost of living in Boise, Idaho is compariable to Salem, Oregon</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Low salary
                <ul>
                   <li>My dad works at the Oregon jail who makes almost $50 per hour. <br> He would make around $25 per hour in Idaho for the exact same job.</li>
                   <li>Low pay with a cost of living comparable to Salem makes living there difficult.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Harsh Weather
                <ul>
                    <li>During the summer, most of Idaho is very hot. It the 90's and 100's.</li>
                    <li>While it's winter, it's always very cold and snows a lot.</li>
            </ul>
                </ul>
        </ol><br><br><br>
        
        <h2>Why I love Idaho</h2>
        
        <p>For these reasons, my parents decided to move to Oregon. I would only recommend living in <br> Boise if you have a lot of money. If you have money, it's a beautiful place <br> to live.</p>
        
        <p>There isn't really any homeless people in sight. Whenever you go to a public park in <br> Salem, it's littered with homeless camps and children can't go to the parks because it's not safe. <br> That's why the only park my mom would ever take me to was a school playground.</p>
        
        <p>They also keep the city very clean and organized. There isn't any trash in sight and <br> the roads are maintained very well. The paint is replaced pretty often. Last summer, my mom's <br> boyfriend went to Boise for the first time on our way to Yellowstone. The moment he <br> got there, he loved it much better than Salem. He also loved the fact that highway <br> speed limits were 80mph.</p>
